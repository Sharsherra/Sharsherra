 <summary><h3>👨‍💻 Sharshera's Coding Journey</h3></summary>
   I’ve been fascinated by technology since I was a kid, but my real motivation to dive into programming started when I began studying engineering. Instead of chasing endless courses or comparing myself to others, I chose to focus on my own growth—mastering the fundamentals, one step at a time. Right now, I’m building a strong foundation in C++, algorithms, and data structures, sharpening my problem-solving skills to become a full-stack developer. But that’s just the beginning. My ultimate goal? To launch my own company and turn ideas into reality through code. The journey is long, but I’m all in.
